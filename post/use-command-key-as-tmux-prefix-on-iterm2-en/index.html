There are almost no usable combinations left.<br>(Ctrl+a, which is set as the default prefix key on tmux, is used for bash It&rsquo;s covered with a shell.)</p><p>So I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with various combinations, and recently, if I were on a Mac, I&rsquo;d use the Command key. Why not use it as a prefix key?<br>It&rsquo;s pretty good.<br>The advantage of using the Command key as a prefix key is.</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s in an easy to press position.</li><li>You can use the terminal tools (vim, bash, and other CLI tools) and shortcuts to create There&rsquo;s nothing to bat for (maybe).</li></ul><p>Being in a position where you can press with your thumb is pretty important as someone who lives in a terminal.<br>If you use a prefix key such as Ctrl which you press with your pinky finger, your pinky finger is dead.<br>You can press Command key to make it work as a prefix key, or you can press <code>It is also possible to set the Command key + '</code> as the tmux pane splitting key, etc. (This is quite an advantage.
(This is also quite an advantage.)</p><h2 id=precondition>Precondition</h2><ul><li>We have confirmed the operation in the following environments<ul><li>macOS Catalina version 10.15.5</li><li>iTerm2 Build 3.3.11</li><li>tmux 3.0a</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=configuration>Configuration</h2><p>Iterm2 has the ability to register your own keyboard shortcuts from the beginning.<br>I can perform various actions (scrolling, copying, etc.) when I type a shortcut. And there is one such action called &ldquo;Send Hex Code&rdquo;. As the name suggests, this action sends you an ASCII code when you type a shortcut.<br>You can use this to have the command key send you the ASCII code of the key you set as the tmux prefix key when you enter the command key.</p><p>You can find out which key corresponds to what hexadecimal number in the ASCII code at the following site</p><p>ASCII : <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII</a></p><h3 id=tmux-side-configuration>tmux-side configuration</h3><p>Actually, the tmux prefix setting isn&rsquo;t just about anything. (This is a slight disadvantage.)<br>From a tmux point of view, we can use <code>Ctrl-&lt;Space></code> as a prefix key.<br>The function of &ldquo;send Hex Code&rdquo; above is to send the same type of code as listed in the ASCII code table above. character or control characters are only supported.</p><p>So, I use control characters that you may not normally use as a prefix key.<br>See Wikipedia for an overview of ASCII control characters and their descriptions.</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII</a></p><p>I set up <code>Ctrl + \</code> as a prefix key for tmux. (The control character is File Separator.)</p><p>If you want to write it as a <code>.tmux.conf</code> setting, you can write it as follows: <code>Ctrl + .tmux.conf</code> (with two back-quotes to escape). (Two back-quotes are added for escaping.)</p><pre><code># prefix key
set -g prefix C-\\

(How to open Preferences is <code>Command key + ,</code>)<br>You can register a new keyboard shortcut from Preferences > Keys > Keys > Key Bindings, using the + button in the bottom left corner.</p><p>Using my settings as an example</p><ol><li>press the + button at the bottom left of Preferences > Keys > Key Bindings.</li><li>you want to use a single press of the Command key as a prefix key, so you can use the " Click on &ldquo;Keyboard Shortcut&rdquo; and press the Command key</li><li>select &ldquo;Send Hex Code&rdquo; in Action</li><li>the control set up as a prefix key there as the input column comes out under the Action.

Thank you for your hard work.</p><h3 id=extra>Extra</h3><p>As an application of the previous settings, we will try to make <code>Command + '</code> behave as if you had pressed the ' key after pressing the prefix key (tmux&rsquo;s default setting is to split the pane).</p><ol><li>press the + button at the bottom left of Preferences > Keys > Key Bindings.</li><li>you want to use the <code>Command key + '</code> as a prefix key, so you can use the " Click on &ldquo;Keyboard Shortcut&rdquo; and press the Command key</li><li>select &ldquo;Send Hex Code&rdquo; in Action</li><li>the control set up as a prefix key there as the input column comes out under the Action.
